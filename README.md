<h1>🍺 Punk Api Project </h1>

This was a _nology project where I used the punk-api along with ReactTs to create an web application that can filter through the beers by name, alcohol content, brew range, beer colour as well as acidity according to the users' preference. 

<h2>✍️What you can do:</h2>
<ul>🟢 Search the name of a product</ul>
<ul>🟢 Filter through the beers using the checkbox options </ul>
<ul>🟢 Use the slider to change the number of beers displayed</ul>

<h2>💻 Technologies used:</h2>
<ul>🔵HTML</ul>
<ul>🔵SCSS</ul>
<ul>🔵Typescript / Javascript</ul>
<ul>🔵ReactJs</ul>

<h2>🧩 Components</h2>
<br>The project is structured with the following components:
<br><br>
<uL><b>App:</b>The root component that uses React Router for navigation.</uL>
<uL><b>Nav:</b> The navigation bar that includes search functionality and filters.</uL>
